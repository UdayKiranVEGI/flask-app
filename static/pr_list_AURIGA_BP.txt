Below are iOS limitations :
1.	For SOS we have a limitation, User need to interact for call action as per Apples privacy policy.
2.	When the rider disconnects and try to connect the HMI First time or 2nd time, rider needs to manually forget the device in settings - iOS default behaviour
3.	Recents, Favorites functionalities not able to implement because of Apple did not allow to access call history/logs 
4.	Outgoing calls feature not needed, because user interaction needed
5.	'Dropped pin' text update as In Maps destination location as iOS Maps are providing that information cant able to change
